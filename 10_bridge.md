# Bridge

- [Instructor] The bridge pattern helps untangle an unnecessarily complicated class hierarchy, especially when implementation-specific classes are mixed with implementation-independent classes. The problem here is that there are two parallel or orthogonal abstractions. One is implementation-specific and the other is implementation-independent. Our scenario involves implementation-independent circle abstraction and implementation-dependent circle abstraction. The implementation-dependent circle abstraction involves how to draw a circle. And the implementation-independent circle abstraction involves defining the properties of a circle and scaling it. Our solution is avoiding abstracting both implementation-specific and implementation-independent classes in a single class hierarchy. The abstract factory and adapter patterns are the related patterns to the bridge design pattern.
