# Decorators

Decorators in Python can be used for:

- Logging function calls and results
- Measuring execution time (profiling)
- Access control and authentication
- Caching results (memoization)
- Input validation and type checking
- Modifying or extending function behavior
- Registering functions (e.g., plugin systems)
- Deprecating functions or issuing warnings

They allow you to add functionality to functions or methods without modifying their code.


According to course decorators can:
- add new features to an existing object
- do dynamic changes
- avoids using subclasses
